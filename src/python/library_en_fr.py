# The following is done only for testing purpose.
# Usually, the "library" tab will have a unique name
# for that language. For example, in French, it is
# named "biblio" which is short for "biblioth√®que".
# However, it can happen that two languages (for example Polish and Lithuanian)
# use the same word for "library". In this case, we need to have a way
# to use the relevant code.

# For testing purpose, this file include code that can
# be used in either English or French.
