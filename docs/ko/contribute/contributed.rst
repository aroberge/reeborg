World contributed by users
==========================

In this section, one will find worlds contributed by users, with attribution.
Ideally each world contributed should contain a description viewable
using the "World info" feature.
If pre- and/or post-code is used, the target human language
used for programming instructions (currently only either English or French)
should be indicated in the description so that the appropriate version
of the website can be used.

Worlds contributed are all under a Creative Commons license, as specified
by the contributor with one exception: world with ND (no derivative)
restrictions will not be accepted.

All original words referred to elsewhere on this site are under
a CC0 (Public Domain) license, unless otherwise explicitly noted.
