Information for artists
===========================

Using nice images can enhance the learning environment and make it
much more appealing, especially for younger learners.   However,
I am well aware of my own limitations when it comes to making nice looking
images.

The current version of Reeborg's World uses png images with transparent backgrounds
and size 40 by 40 pixels.
[This unusual size has been chosen for historical reasons.]
Many of these images have been adapted from
images found on https://openclipart.org.

If you would like to contribute some additional and/or nicer artwork, please
get in touch.
