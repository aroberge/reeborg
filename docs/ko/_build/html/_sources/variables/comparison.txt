Comparison operators
====================

It is sometimes very useful to compare objects. We'll start with numbers.

.. topic:: Try this!

    .. code-block:: py3

        print( 2 == 2 )  # are the two numbers equal?
        print( 2 == 3 )

        print( 2 != 2 )  # are the two numbers different?
        print( 2 != 3 )

        print( 2 < 3 )  # is the first number smaller than the second?
        print( 3 < 2 )
        print( 2 < 2 )

        print( 2 > 3 )  # is the first number greater than the second?
        print( 3 > 2 )
        print( 2 > 2 )

        print( 2 <= 3 )  # is the first number smaller than or equal to the second?
        print( 3 <= 2 )
        print( 2 <= 2 )

        print( 2 >= 3 )  # is the first number greater than or equal the second?
        print( 3 >= 2 )
        print( 2 >= 2 )
