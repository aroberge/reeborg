A character in a string
=============================

.. todo::

    Immediately after having introduced lists and selecting an item by its
    index, do the same for strings.

    However, show the difference between mutable lists and immutable strings.
    Then, introduce tuples.  Make sure to show that parentheses are NOT
    required for defining tuples -- and, in fact, show how to define
    a tuple with a single element.
