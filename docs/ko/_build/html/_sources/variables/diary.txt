Reeborg's diary
===============

.. index:: print(), function argument

Have Reeborg execute the following program::

    print()

You should see a pop-up window appear with the title *Reeborg writes:*.
This window is Reeborg's diary.  Feel free to move it around
on your computer screen.

.. note::

    **Important:** the example on the right does not execute the
    function ``move``; if we do::

        print( move() )

    so that ``move`` is executed, the Python keyword ``None`` will
    be printed.  What that is the case will be explained later.

Now, run the following program::

    print(move)

At the time I wrote this tutorial, the result in Reeborg's diary was

    <function _move_>

``_move_`` is the secret name of the ``move`` function as known
to Reeborg. We can verify this by running the following::

    step = move
    print(step)
    print(move)

The result is::

    <function _move_>
    <function _move_>

.. note::

    ``pass`` is a Python keyword which meand "do nothing".
    It is useful to take the place of a block of code which
    is required for having the proper structure (indentation) in a
    program but which is not otherwise needed.

If you define a completely new function, like::

    def hello():
        pass

    print(hello)

the result will be::

    <function hello>


A function can have an argument
-------------------------------

In computer programs, the word **argument** refers to a variable
that determines the result of a function.
For example, as we have seen::

    print(move)

the variable ``move`` is the argument of the function ``print()``.
The argument of a function appears between the parentheses which
indicate that the function is called.


Writing text
------------

Writing the name of a function like we have done above by
using the ``print()`` function is something that is done
**extremely** rarely when writing programs.
What is done much, much more often is to write text.

In programming terms, a *character* is any letter, number or symbol that
can be printed and a *string of characters*, or simply *string*, is any
sequence of character that can be printed. For example, try the
following::

    print("Hello world!")
    print('Hello again.')

.. index:: \', \", \n, escape character, escape sequence

Note that the quotes that surround the *string* have to be the same,
either double quotes like ", or single quotes like '. To have a string
that contains some quote characters, we can either surround it by quotes
of a different type or use the *escape character* ``\``::

    print("Let's go.")
    print('Let\'s go.')

We can combine strings using the ``+`` symbol::

    print("Goodbye! " + "And thanks for all the fish.")

We can also start on a new line using the following *escape sequence*:
``\n``::

    print("Thank you. \nTry again")

.. topic:: Try it!

    Make sure you try to run the above code samples or some similar.


Reeborg knows mathematics
-------------------------

.. index:: +, *, -, /, //

.. topic:: Try this!

    Try running the following program and look at the output in Reeborg's
    diary.

    .. code-block:: py3

        print( 2 + 3 )  # adding numbers
        print( 2 * 3 )  # multiplying numbers
        print( 3 - 2 )  # subtracting numbers
        print( 6 / 2 )  # dividing numbers
        print( 1 + 3 * 2 ) # multiplication is done before addition

        # using parentheses to change normal order of operations
        print( (1 + 3) * 2 )

        print( 2 ** 5 ) # power ... 2**5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2* 2

.. note::

    Note that spaces around the operators like ``+`` and ``*``
    are ignored by Python; however, they can make it easier for humans
    to read the code.

In the above examples, the result was always an integer (or whole number)
except when dividing numbers which gave a **floating point** number:
``6 / 2`` gives ``3.0``.

If we want the result of dividing two numbers to be an integer,
we use the double division sign instead::

    print( 6 // 2 )  # integer division

Using variables
---------------

We have already seen the idea of using different names (variables) as synonyms.
Let's use this idea again as explore
mathematical operations some more::

    length = 4
    width = 6
    area = length * width  # area of a rectangle
    print(area)            # will output 24

.. topic:: Try it!

    Make up your own examples and run them.


.. important::

   The *character* "2" is not the same as the *number* 2.  Try out
   the following::

       print("2" + 2)

Multiple arguments
-------------------

Some functions, like ``print()``, can take many arguments: the
various arguments are separated by commas.
To illustrate this, try out the following program::


    length = 4
    width = 6
    area = length * width
    print("The area of a rectangle of length", length,
          "and width", width, "is", area)
