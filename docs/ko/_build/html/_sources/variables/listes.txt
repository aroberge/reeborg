Lists
==========


.. todo::

    Explain what lists are and how one can select a single element
    using its index.

    Have an example in a world where one must move plants from one
    row to another, keeping the same number of plants at each spot.
    But before, make sure a similar example will have been done
    with a single set of plants, using increments to count the number
    of plants.
