Summary
=======

It is yet time again to review what we have learned.  We now have seen
six additional Python keywords:

-  ``if``
-  ``elif``
-  ``else``
-  ``True``
-  ``False``
-  ``not``

in addition to the three we had first seen.:

-  ``def``
-  ``from``
-  ``import``

We have seen four functions which help inform Reeborg about the
state of its world:

-  ``object_here()``
-  ``at_goal()``
-  ``front_is_clear()``
-  ``wall_in_front()``

We have also seen another function:

-  ``done()``

which is in addition to:

-  ``move()``
-  ``turn_left()``
-  ``take()``
-  ``put()``
-  ``pause()``
-  ``build_wall()``
