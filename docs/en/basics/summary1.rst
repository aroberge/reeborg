Summary

It is time to review what you have learned so far. In addition to
getting familiar with the environment on this site, you have learned the
first two rules for learning about programming.

.. important::

    **Rule # 1**

        Learning about computer programming is like learning to play a
        musical instrument: you have to **do it**, not simply read about it.

    **Rule # 2**

        Write your computer programs to make them easy for **people** to
        read and understand.

Related to Rule # 2, we have seen how we can include *comments* as a
mean to communicate some information to other humans, information that
will be ignored by the computer.

While I have not mentioned this explicitly, you have also learned that a
program is a series of instructions. You have seen a total of 5
different instructions:

-  ``move()``
-  ``turn_left()``
-  ``take()``
-  ``put()``
-  ``pause()``

You may or may not have used the ``pause()`` instruction which I only
mentioned in passing when talking about bugs. If you have not done so,
you might want to write a short program that includes it just to see
what happens; make sure that the ``pause()`` instruction is neither the
first instruction nor the last one so that you can plainly see what it does.
