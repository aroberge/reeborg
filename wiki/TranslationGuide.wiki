#summary A quick guide for people who want to translate Reeborg's World

= Introduction =

Reeborg's world is designed to be adapted to various programming languages (with Javascript as the prototype and Python intended to be a second version) and various human languages, with English as the first version and a French translation provided by its creator.

This short guide indicates what needs to be done to provide a translation.


= Details =

Robot instructions and lessons are intended to be translated.

Robot instructions (and various strings used in communicating with the user) are found in a javascript file.  The name of that file uses a convention so that a code indicating the programming language used as well as a standard two-letter code indicating the human language are appended at the end of "reeborg".  Thus, the English javascript file is src/js/reeborg_js_en.js  whereas a (currently non-existent) French python file would be src/js/reeborg_py_fr.js

In addition, lessons are translated as well.  Lessons are simple xml files (html fragments) that are loaded via ajax in a window.

In order to help keep translation in sync, *filenames use the same name as the English version*.  Thus, the lesson that introduces the `move()` command is move.xml even though the French name (for example) for the command is `avance()`.   However, these filenames are found in a directory that refers to the relevant languages (programming and human). Thus, the English lessons for Javascript are in directory 
src/xml_js_en/
