About Reeborg's World
============================================

Please consult the documentation which can be found at
http://reeborg.ca/docs/en/

It includes information for users (educators and students) as
well as potential contributors (developers, translators, artists).

Permission is given to make copies
on some other site, *but* I would request that you contact me to inform me
so that I can add the information about where Reeborg is used and so that
I can keep you abreast of any new development.
