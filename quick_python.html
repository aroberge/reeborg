<h1>Quick Python tutorial using Reeborg's World</h1>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you already know at least one programming
language and you want to have a quick introduction to Python using
Reeborg's world.  The goal is not to be comprehensive, but to give you an
idea of what it is like to program in Python using a visual environment
instead of boring print statements.</p>
<p>
To follow this tutorial, you should have Reeborg's World (the executable version) in a separate window.
You can open such a window by clicking "Open World" above and make sure that Python
is selected in the header.
It if opens in a new tab, you might want to "pull" the tab so that
it is in a separate window of its own. It should look like the following:</p>
<p><img src="src/images/world.png" alt="Reeborg's world window"></p>
<p>Reeborg's world uses <a href="http://brython.info">Brython</a>
to convert Python 3 code in Javascript that is then run in the browser.</p>
<h2>Hello <small><small>Reeborg's</small></small> world</h2>
<p>In the other window, on the left, you should see Reeborg alone in its world.
On the right, you should see an editor with the following line of code:</p>
<pre class="pycode">move()</pre>
<p class="try">Click on the "execute"
or "run" button <img src="src/images/play.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="run"/>
to make sure that everything is working as it should.</p>
<p>Assuming everything is set up correctly, Reeborg should have moved and
the "execute" button
    <img src="src/images/play.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="run"/> is now disabled.
    Click on <img src="src/images/reload.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="reload"/>
    to enable it again, so that you can run the program again.</p>
<h2>Python functions</h2>
<p>The instruction <code>move()</code> is an example of a Python function.
To be able to execute a function, we must have three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It must have a valid name; it this case, it is <code>move</code>.
    Valid names must start with either a letter or the underscore character "_"
    and may contain letters, numbers or the underscore character "_". In Python
    3, non-ascii characters are allowed; however, Brython (currently) does
    not recognize them as valid characters.
    <pre class="pycode">prénom = "Guido" # e-acute valid in Python 3 but not in Brython</pre>
    </li>
    <li>It must be invoked, by adding <code>()</code> after its name.</li>
    <li>On its own (i.e. not within a block ...),
    it must start at the beginning of a line, with no space in front.
    Space at the beginning of a line (indentation) is meaningful in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p class="try">Type (or copy-paste) the following code in the editor and run it.</p>
<pre class="pycode">
# This is a comment
move()   # another comment
m = move # alternative name defined
m()      # execute
turn_left()   # another function that Reeborg knows.</pre>
<p>Note that Python is case-sensitive.  Verify this by trying to run the
following program:</p>
<pre class="pycode">Move()</pre>
<h2>Other functions in Reeborg's world</h2>
<p>If you click on "Help" in the other tab/window where programs
are run, you will see a list of functions specific to Reeborg's world.</p>
<h2>Defining functions</h2>
<p>While Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, it often uses
functions as first-class objects.</p>
<p>Here is how one defines a simple function in Python:</p>
<pre class="pycode">
def move2():   # note the colon ":"  and the "def" keyword
    move()   # blocks are defined by indentation
    move()

move2()    # use it</pre>
<p class="try">Try it!</p>
<p>Other than for indentation, and delimiting names and keywords, spaces
have no meaning in Python. So, the following, while not quite as readable, is equivalent to
what we wrote immediately above.</p>
<pre class="pycode">
def    move2  (    )   :
    move  ()
    move(  )
move2  (  )</pre>
<h2>Python 3 keywords</h2>

<pre class="pycode">
False      None      True      and          as
assert     break     class     continue     def
del        elif      else      except       finally
for        from      global    if           import
in         is        lambda    nonlocal     not
or         pass      raise     return       try
while      with      yield </pre>


<h2>For loops</h2>
<p class="try">Currently, Reeborg is in a world called <span class="world">Alone</span>.
Select instead the world <span class="world">Center 1</span> and have
Reeborg execute the following program:</p>
<pre class="pycode">for a_variable in range(2):  # range is a builtin function
    move()
put()  </pre>
<p>As you can see, Reeborg takes 2 steps and
puts down a "token" at the center of its world.</p>
<p class="try">
Select world <span class="world">Center 2</span> and modify the
above code (by changing a single character) so that Reeborg execute
the correct task.</p>
<h2>If statements</h2>
<p>Click on "Diary" at the top of the other window so that we
can see what Reeborg writes using <code>print()</code>.</p>
<p class="try">Select world <span class="world">Home 1</span> and run
the following:</p>
<pre class="pycode">
for a_variable in range(10):  # more than enough repetitions
    move()
    print( a_variable )
    if at_goal():
        turn_left()    # for no good reason
        turn_left()    # other than seeing the block structure
        break     # out of the for loop</pre>

<h2>While loops and negation</h2>
<p class="try">Try the following, still with world <span class="world">Home 1</span></p>
<pre class="pycode">while not at_goal():
    move()</pre>
<p>Alternatively, run the following:</p>
<pre class="pycode">while front_is_clear():
    move()</pre>
<p>One more thing to try:</p>
<pre class="pycode">while front_is_clear() and not at_goal():
    move()
move() # after the while loop</pre>
<p><code>front_is_clear()</code> and <code>at_goal()</code> are two functions
that return boolean values.</p>
<h2>Test your understanding</h2>
<p>If you did not already know programming, you should be reading
the other, much slower pace tutorial.  Since you already know how to program,
and are presumably reading this to get a quick overview of Python, it is
time to see if you understood what you read so far.
</p>
<p class="try"> Using if statements and while loops, and strategically
putting down tokens and picking them up, write a single program that
can have Reeborg solve the required task for both worlds
<span class="world">Center 1</span> and <span class="world">Center 2</span>.  Once
you have a solution, extend it so that it works also for
<span class="world">Center 3</span>.  Your program should be written so that
it would work for any similar rectangular worlds, without using variables
to count Reeborg's steps and figure out the size of its world.
Note that Reeborg carries only 2 tokens.</p>
<h2>Newspaper delivery</h2>
<p>Python functions can take arguments. We give an example through a story.</p>
<p>Reeborg has a new job: he delivers the <em>Northern Star</em> newspaper.
Many of Reeborg's customers do not live on the ground floor of their building.
For each of these customers,
Reeborg has to do the following</p>
<ol><li>Pick up a single copy of the newspaper (it would be too heavy to
carry them all up the stairs).</li>
<li>Climb up the required number of floors to reach the customer's door.</li>
<li>Get the money (tokens) left by the customer.</li>
<li>Leave a copy of the newspaper (simply nicknamed the <em>star</em>) behind.</li>
<li>Climb down to the ground level</li>
</ol>

<p>While Reeborg has many clients, I only included two with their corresponding
worlds:</p>
<ul><li>The nice Ms. Ada Lovelace, who lives on the third floor of her building,
always leaves a couple of extra tokens as a gift to Reeborg; hers is
world <span class="world">Newspaper&nbsp;1</span>.</li>
<li>The old curmudgeon Mr. Charles Babbage, who lives on the fifth floor, always
pays the exact amount, leaving no tip for Reeborg; his world is
<span class="world">Newspaper&nbsp;2</span></li></ul>
<p>With the help of the following two instructions:</p>
<pre class="pycode">take("star")   # pick it up to carry
put('star')    # single quotes or double quotes can be used to surround strings</pre>
<p>we can make Reeborg complete at least one delivery.  Here's
a program to deliver a newspaper to Ms. Lovelace.</p>
<pre class="pycode">
def turn_around():
    repeat(turn_left, 2)

def turn_right():
    repeat(turn_left, 3)

def upstairs():
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    move()

def downstairs():
    move()
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()

take("star")
repeat(upstairs, 3)
while token_here():
    take()
put("star")
turn_around()
repeat(downstairs, 3)</pre>
<p>Also, note that Reeborg can only turn to its left.  To have Reeborg turn
to its right, it must make 3 left turns as defined above.</p>
<p class="try">Modify the above program so that Reeborg can use it to
deliver newspapers to the two clients.  You only need to replace two
lines by two short loops. You already have seen all the required functions.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the <code>repeat</code> function that takes two
arguments, one of which is a function name; this function is specific to
Reeborg's world.  Here is one way that
one could define such a function in Python:</p>
<pre class="pycode">def repeat(f, n):
    for i in range(n):
        f()
</pre>
<h2>if/elif/else</h2>
<p>You are probably already familiar with the idea of various branches
depending on conditions tested by if statements.  One can have
a series of exclusive if statements, denoted as "else if" in
some programming languages which is shortened as "elif" in Python.</p>
<pre class="pycode">
select_world("Maze 1")
think(0)
def turn_right():
    repeat(turn_left, 3)

def follow_right_wall():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move();
    elif False:   # just to illustrate
        pass
    else:
        turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    follow_right_wall()</pre>
<p>Note that the first instruction will switch to the appropriate world
and terminate if that world is different from the one that was previously
selected.  Running the program again will work as expected.</p>


<h2>A bit of fun</h2>
<p>When you looked at the code for the newspaper delivery example,
you probably noticed that, to go down a stair, Reeborg had to do operations
in the reverse order than that for going up a stair, while exchanging
left turns and right turns.  Instead of hard-coding a function for
going up (or down) stairs, we can create a list of instructions that
can be <code>exec</code>uted one by one by Python. <small>[<code>exec</code>
can actually execute more than one instruction at a time, but
we will not do so in the following example.]</small> Python lists are equivalent
to "arrays" in some other languages. By reversing the list,
using a specific Python idiom, and interchanging left and right turns,
again using a Python idiom that does not require the use of an
intermediate variable like one might do in most languages</p>
<pre class="pycode">temp = left
left = right
right = temp</pre>
<p>but is done as follows:</p>
<pre class="pycode">left, right = right, left</pre>
<p>one can have Reeborg deliver correctly the newspaper.</p>
<pre class="pycode">
left = turn_left

def right():
    repeat(left, 3)

def turn_around():
    repeat(left, 2)

def move2():
    repeat(move, 2)

def exec_commands(a_list):
    for cmd in a_list:
        exec(cmd)

upstairs = ["left()", "move()", "right()", "move2()"]  # a Python list

take("star")
while not token_here():
    exec_commands(upstairs)
while token_here():
    take()
put("star")
turn_around()

downstairs = upstairs[::-1]  # create reverse list
left, right = right, left              # tuple interchange!
while not at_goal():
    exec_commands(downstairs)</pre>

<h2>OOP: Reeborg the UsedRobot</h2>
<p>Python is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. Objects
can have attributes (variables) belonging to them as well as <em>methods</em>,
which is the name given to a function that belongs to an object.
The symbol used to indicate that an attribute or method belongs to a particular
object (aka instance of a class [of objects]) is a ".".</p>
<p class="try">Select world "Empty" and run the following program:</p>
<pre class="pycode">reeborg = UsedRobot()
reeborg.move()
karel = UsedRobot(4, 4, 'n')
karel.move()
reeborg.turn_left()
reeborg.move()</pre>

<h2>Importing modules</h2>
<p>In a Python program, one can import an existing module (other program) to
make use of its functions.  Python is often described as "batteries included"
for the number of useful modules that are part of its standard library.</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to simulate throwing a normal die (not one of those
fancy non-cubic dice), one that can give an integer from 1 to 6 as its result.
To do so in Python, we can make use of the <code>randint</code> method
found in the random module.</p>
<p>Below are four equivalent ways to make the <code>randint</code>
function available in a program.  <b>Do not do this yet!</b></p>
<pre class="pycode">import random
result = random.randint(1, 6)</pre>
<pre class="pycode">from random import randint
result = randint(1, 6)</pre>
<pre class="pycode">import random as choice
result = choice.randint(1, 6)</pre>
<pre class="pycode">from random import randint as die
result = die(1, 6)</pre>
<p>The random module is included in the Brython distribution. However,
when importing the random module in Python, various other modules
are imported as well behind the scene.  This is done very rapidly when
running Python locally.  Brython however uses ajax calls to import modules.
A total of 45 calls have to be made when importing random <b>for the first
time</b> in a given browser session.  This is <b>slow</b>.
However, a mostly compatible
pure javascript module is included in the Brython distribution, and this
is what we will use in the next example.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>We've already mentioned that Python is an OOP.  In Python, objects are
instances of a given class. <small>[Python modules are also objects in the
sense that they have their own methods and attributes.]</small> We
have mentioned that <code>UsedRobot</code> was a class.  Instances
of that class have a number of methods.  Suppose we wish to create a new
class of objects that inherits all the existing methods of another one,
and add new methods.  We can easily do this in Python as shown in the
following example:</p>

<pre class="pycode">
select_world("Maze 1")
from __random import randint  # using the special Brython module
think(0)                # speeding things up as this program may take a while
RUR.MAX_STEPS = 10000   # Try to make sure we will not stop the program early

class Gambler(UsedRobot):

    def roll_die(self):
        return randint(1, 6)

    def turn_right(self):
        self.turn_left()
        self.turn_left()
        self.turn_left()

del RUR.current_world.robots[0]  # remove existing UsedRobot

lucky = Gambler()

while not lucky.at_goal():
    result = lucky.roll_die()
    if result &lt; 5:
        if lucky.front_is_clear():
            lucky.move()
        else:
            result = lucky.roll_die()
            if result in [1, 2, 3]:
                lucky.turn_left()
            else:
                lucky.turn_right()
    elif result == 5:
        lucky.turn_left()
    else:
        lucky.turn_right()</pre>

<p>The above approach, where "lucky" checks to see if there is a wall
before attempting a move is known as "loop before you leap".  There is
an alternative approach one might use, known as "better ask forgiveness
than permission".  Hitting a wall raises an exception in Reeborg's world.
We can catch this exception <small>[using a "bare" <code>except</code> which
is not usually recommended but done here because of some technical
limitations of Reeborg's World]</small> and handle it ourselves. </p>
<p class="try">Modify the previous code by changing it as
written below. Open up Reeborg's Diary to see how the
<code>finally</code> clause is always executed.</p>

<pre class="pycode" title="20">
    if result &lt; 5:
        try:
            lucky.move()
            message = "ok"
        except:
            message = "ouch!"
            result = lucky.roll_die()
            if result &lt; 4:
                lucky.turn_left()
            else:
                lucky.turn_right()
        finally:
            write(message)
</pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This conclude our very quick look at Python using Reeborg's world.</p>
