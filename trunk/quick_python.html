<h1>Quick Python Tutorial using Reeborg's world</h1>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you already know at least one programming
language and you want to have a quick introduction to Python using
Reeborg's world.  
To follow this tutorial, you should have Reeborg's World (the executable version) in a separate window.
You can open such a window by clicking "Open World" above and make sure that Python
is selected in the header.
It if opens in a new tab, you might want to "pull" the tab so that 
it is in a separate window of its own. It should look like the following:</p>
<p><img src="src/images/world.png" alt="Reeborg's world window"></p>
<p>Reeborg's world uses <a href="http://brython.info">Brython</a>
to convert Python 3 code in Javascript that is then run in the browser.</p>
<h2>First step</h2>
<p>In the other window, on the left, you should see Reeborg alone in its world.  
On the right, you should see an editor with the following line of code:</p>
<pre class="pycode">move()</pre>
<p>Click on the "execute"  
or "run" button <img src="src/images/play.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="run"/>
and watch what happens.</p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You had Reeborg take its first step.
Notice how the "execute" button 
    <img src="src/images/play.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="run"/> is now disabled.
    Click on <img src="src/images/reload.png" class="blue-gradient" alt="reload"/> 
    to enable it again, so that you can run the program again.</p>
<h2>Python functions</h2>
<p>The instruction <code>move()</code> is an example of a Python function.
To be able to execute a function, we must have three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It must have a valid name; it this case, it is <code>move</code>.</li>
    <li>It must be invoked, by adding <code>()</code> after its name.</li>
    <li>On its own (i.e. not within a block ...), 
    it must start at the beginning of a line, with no space in front.
    Space at the beginning of a line (indentation) is meaningful in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter the following code in the editor and run it.</p>
<pre class="pycode"># This is a comment
move()   # another comment
m = move # alternative name defined
m()      # execute
turn_left()   # another function that Reeborg knows.
</pre>
<p>Note that Python is case-sensitive.  Verify this by trying to run the
following program:</p>
<pre class="pycode">Move()</pre>
<h2>Other functions in Reeborg's world</h2>
<p>If you click on "Help" in the other tab/window where programs
are run, you will see a list of functions specific to Reeborg's world.</p>
<h2>Defining functions</h2>
<p>While Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, it often uses
functions as first-class objects.  In fact, this tutorial will focus mostly
on simple functions and control flow.</p>
<p>Here is how one defines a simple function in Python:</p>
<pre class="pycode">def move2():   # note the colon, :, and the "def" keyword
    move()   # blocks are defined by indentation
    move()   
    
move2()    # use it
</pre>
<p>Other than for indentation, and delimiting names and keywords, spaces
have no meaning in Python. So, the following, while not quite as readable, is equivalent to
what we wrote immediately above.</p>
<pre class="pycode">def    move2  (    )   :
    move  ()
    move(  )   
move2  (  )
</pre>
<h2>For loops</h2>
<p>Currently, Reeborg's is in a world called <span class="world">Alone</span>.
Select instead the world <span class="world">Center 1</span> and have
Reeborg execute the following program:</p>
<pre class="pycode">for a_variable in range(2):
    move()
put()  
</pre>
<p>As you can see, Reeborg takes 2 steps and 
puts down a "token" at the center of its world.
Select world <span class="world">Center 2</span> and modify the
above code (by changing a single character) so that Reeborg execute
the correct task.</p>
<h2>If statements</h2>
<p>Click on "Diary" at the top of the other window so that we
can see what Reeborg writes using <code>print()</code>.</p>
<p>Select world <span class="world">Home 1</span> and run
the following:</p>
<pre class="pycode">for a_variable in range(10):  # more than enough repetitions
    move()
    write( a_variable )
    if at_goal():
        turn_left()    # for no good reason
        turn_left()    # other than seeing the block structure
        break     # out of the for loop
</pre>
<p>We used <code>write()</code>, which is specific to Reeborg's world,
instead of <code>print()</code>, which is the Python version, as 
<code>write()</code> has been defined to be "in step" with the execution
of the Python code.   
The way the code is run in Reeborg's world is as follows: the
entire program is translated from Python into Javascript and run
at once; each basic action results in a "frame" being recorded. These
frames are then played back one at a time.  <code>print()</code>
statements are written in Reeborg's diary as the program is executed.
<code>write()</code> statements are recorded in a given frame
and appear in Reeborg's diary at the appropriate moment in the
play back.</p>

<h2>While loops and negation</h2>
<p>Try the following, still with world <span class="world">Home 1</span></p>
<pre class="pycode">while not at_goal():   # notice the "not" keyword
    move()
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, run the following:</p>
<pre class="pycode">while front_is_clear():
    move()
</pre>
<p>Then, try adding one more move instruction, as in:</p>
<pre class="pycode">while front_is_clear():
    move()
move() # after the while loop
</pre>
<h2>Test your understanding</h2>
<p>Using if statements and while loops, write a single program that
can have Reeborg solve the required task for both worlds
<span class="world">Center 1</span> and <span class="world">Center 2</span>.  Once
you have a solution, extend it so that it works also for
<span class="world">Center 3</span></p>
