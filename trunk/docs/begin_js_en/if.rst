If only ...
===========

If only Reeborg could decide on its own, writing programs would be much
simpler ... **WAIT !** Didn't I tell you: Reeborg can make decisions on
its own.

Javascript keyword: ``if``
--------------------------

.. topic:: Do it!

    Select an appropriate world (perhaps **Alone**), and have Reeborg execute
    the program below.

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (true) {
        move();
    }

    if (false) {
        turn_left();
    }

``true`` and ``false`` are Javascript keywords as well. You might want
to interchange them and run the program again to see what happens.

``if`` statement
----------------

The so-called ``if`` **statement** follows a pattern somewhat similar to
that of ``function``\ s ::

    function some_name() {
        // block of code
    }

    if (some_condition) {
        // block of code
    }

How to think of ``if`` statements
---------------------------------

When we introduced functions, we explained how we could think of a
function **call** as being somewhat equivalent to inserting the code block for
the function definition at that point in the program. Thus::

    move();
    turn_right();  // function call
    move();

is equivalent to::

    move();
    // begin of code block inside turn_right()
    turn_left();
    turn_left();
    turn_left();
    // end of code block
    move();

``if`` statements can be thought in similar terms, except that we have a
*conditional* insertion (or rather **deletion**!). Thus::

    move();
    if (true) {
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
    }
    move();

is equivalent to::

    move();
    turn_left();
    turn_left();
    move();

whereas::

    move();
    if (false) {
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
    }
    move();

is equivalent to::

    move();
    move();

Note that thinking of it this way does not mean that such a deletion
would be done permanently: if, somehow, our program *looped back* and
repeated this part of the code again, the ``if`` statement would be
reevaluated each time to decide whether or not to execute the lines of
code inside the code block.

More useful that you might think...
-----------------------------------

Having to specify ``true`` or ``false`` does not help Reeborg decide on
its own. However, there are special functions that Reeborg recognizes
that allow to decide things for himself. The first of these is
``token_here()`` which tells Reeborg that there is at least one token at
the grid position where he is located. For example, if we want to ask
Reeborg to collect tokens, one part of the code could be::

    if ( token_here() ) {
        take();
    }

Have a look at worlds **Tokens 1** and **Tokens 2**. In both cases, and assuming
that Reeborg moves forward in a straight line, when he finds a token,
all he as to do is:

#. take it
#. move to the next grid
#. put the token down
#. move one more step
#. and he is ``done()``

where I have introduced a new command that Reeborg understands:
``done()``. Actually, you should think of this command as Reeborg saying
it himself and declaring that he has finished.

Let's write the outline of a program that will work in both worlds
**Tokens 1** and **Tokens 2**::

    function move_until_done() {
        move();
        if ( token_here() ){
            // something
            // something else
            // something else again
            // yet one more
            done();
        }
    }

    repeat(move_until_done, 42);

Why 42? ... well, I just want to be sure that Reeborg will take enough
steps no matter what world he is in. So far, all the worlds are small
enough that this should be fine. I agree, it does not seem very smart
... We'll see how to fix that later.

.. topic:: Try it!

    Copy the above in the Code editor, filling in the missing
    commands, and test your program on both worlds **Tokens 1** and **Tokens 2**.
