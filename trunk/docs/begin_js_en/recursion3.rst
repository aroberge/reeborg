More recursion
==============

The last program we considered was the following::

    function go_home(){
        if (!at_goal()) {
            move();
            go_home();
        }
        turn_left();
    }

    // now do it!
    go_home();

By now, you probably have figured out how it works; at the very least,
you should have tried to run it! Let's analyze it assuming we run it in
world **HomeÂ 1**. As usual, we consider the single instruction::

    go_home();

which gets replace by the body of the function definition::

    if (!at_goal()) {
        move();
        go_home();
    }
    turn_left();

Since Reeborg has not reached its goal yet,
the ``if`` statement block is executed::

        move();
        go_home();
    turn_left();

Once again, we replace ``go_home()`` by its definition::

        move();
        if (!at_goal()) {
            move();
            go_home();
        }
        turn_left();
    turn_left();

and do it one more time::

        move();
            move();
            if (!at_goal()) {
                move();
                go_home();
            }
            turn_left();
        turn_left();
    turn_left();

After the second ``move()`` instruction, Reeborg has reached its goal
and the ``if`` statement block is not executed::

        move();
            move();
            //if (!at_goal()) {
            //    move();
            //    go_home();
            //}
            turn_left();
        turn_left();
    turn_left();
    
.. note::

   ``go_home`` is called three times ... and Reeborg does three left turns.
   This is perhaps something that Reeborg can use to count ...  Remember this!

Thus, after reaching its goal, Reeborg does three left turns (a
celebratory dance perhaps?) before ending its program.

.. topic:: Try it!

   By running it, 
   check that the recursive program does indeed result in having Reeborg
   make three left turns at the end.

Another test
------------

Using again the same world, can you figure out what would be Reeborg's
final orientation if he executes the following program?

.. code-block:: javascript

    function go_home(){
        move();
        if (!at_goal()) {
            go_home();
            turn_left();
        }
        turn_left();
    }

    // now do it!
    go_home();
    
.. topic:: Do this!

    Try to figure out the above program without running it 
    and then check your understanding
    by seeing Reeborg in action.  What would happen if Reeborg were already
    at its goal before running the program?
