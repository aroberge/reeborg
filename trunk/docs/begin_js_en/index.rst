Learn Javascript with Reeborg!
==============================

Learning Javascript is easy with Reeborg.  All you have to do is read the tutorial
and try all the examples in `Reeborg's world <../../world.html>`_.
I suggest that you keep the tutorial and Reeborg's World both open but
in separate windows or tabs.

Before you actually start the tutorial, have Reeborg take its first step
by running a program in Reeborg's World.


Hints are clickable and designed to provide useful pointers if you are
not sure how to proceed. 

.. hint::

    Go to `Reeborg's world <../../world.html>`_, click on the "run" button
    (small white triangle on blue background)
    and watch Reeborg takes its first step.  
    You can also `view this short video <http://youtu.be/yTdw97KNgGM>`_ 
    to see what it looks like.  You may want to watch it in full screen with
    HD quality selected.
