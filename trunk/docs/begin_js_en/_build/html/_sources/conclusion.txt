Conclusion
===============

This brings us to the end of this tutorial.  There is much more to learn about
Javascript; in particular, there are many more mathematical operations. 
We suggest that you read through `Expressions and
Operators <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators>`__
on the `Mozilla Developer
Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>`__ resources to find out
more about the available operators before learning about Object Oriented
Programming in a more advanced tutorial.
