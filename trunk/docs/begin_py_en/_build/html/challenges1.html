<h1>8. Introduction to the challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-the-challenges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this lesson, I introduce briefly most of the challenges (tasks) that
Reeborg has to accomplish and which you can select from the menu
above Reeborg&#8217;s world. What you
have to do, is to write programs that accomplish what is being described
as being Reeborg&#8217;s task. <strong>You do not have to do all the challenges.</strong>
The idea at this point is to get familiar with the way that Reeborg
moves and to identify patterns that reoccur when finding a given
solution.</p>
<p>While you write your programs, each of which will consist of a specific
of series of instructions, you have the advantage of seeing the entire
world all at once. You should start to think about how Reeborg, who only sees the
grid square where he is located, could take advantage of clues to
determine its next action; this will be useful later on.</p>
<div class="section" id="important-information-about-saving-your-work">
<h2>8.1. Important information about saving your work<a class="headerlink" href="#important-information-about-saving-your-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By making use of something known as <em>Local Storage</em>, Reeborg&#8217;s World remembers
the last program you work on in a given browser (Firefox or Chrome).
However, it might be useful for you to save your programs on your computer,
or on a usb key.  You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button at the
right of the Python editor tab.  Similarly, you can retrieve a program
from your computer using the <strong>Load</strong> button.</p>
<p>If you do save your programs, you will have to note for which
world they are designed. To do so you can use comments. Alternatively,
and this is perhaps a better option, you can use the special command
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">select_world(&quot;world_name_here&quot;)</span></tt> as the first instruction. For
example, a solution to world Home&nbsp;1 would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-py3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">select_world</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Home 1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">move</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">move</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Try it!</p>
<p>Without selecting world <strong>Home&nbsp;1</strong>, run the program above.  The first
time it will simply select the correct world and stop. If you try running it a
second time, it will run with the right world selected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-the-center">
<h2>8.2. Finding the center<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-the-center" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the first of our series of mini challenges.</p>
<p>Have a look at the worlds <strong>Center&nbsp;1</strong> to <strong>Center&nbsp;3</strong>.
In each case, you will have to write a
program that has Reeborg put a token at the geometric center of the
rectangular room he finds himself in.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Try this!</p>
<p>Write a program for only one of these worlds for now.</p>
</div>
<p>Later, you will be able to write a single program that will have Reeborg
find the geometric center of any rectangular room (with odd dimensions
on each side) and have it put a token at that exact location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="around-the-world">
<h2>8.3. Around the world<a class="headerlink" href="#around-the-world" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Have a look at the worlds <strong>Around&nbsp;1</strong> to <strong>Around&nbsp;4</strong>. For at least one of
these worlds, write a program that will have Reeborg go all around the
world coming back at its original starting location, always moving next
to a wall.</p>
<p>Later, we will come back to these challenges and show you how to write
programs that are much shorter and, will work for all of these four
worlds and any similar worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lost-in-a-maze">
<h2>8.4. Lost in a maze<a class="headerlink" href="#lost-in-a-maze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reeborg is lost in a maze. Have a look at the worlds <strong>Maze&nbsp;1</strong> and <strong>Maze&nbsp;2</strong>.
Can you think of a way to write a program that could get Reeborg out of both
of these mazes? Later, you will learn how to do this and, in fact, you will
write a program that could help Reeborg get out of almost any
maze you could think of.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jumping-over-hurdles">
<h2>8.5. Jumping over hurdles<a class="headerlink" href="#jumping-over-hurdles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reeborg has entered a race. It&#8217;s the 110 meters hurdles race, in
preparation for the Olympics. Have a look at the world <strong>Hurdles&nbsp;1</strong> and
have Reeborg complete the race, staying as low as he can, just jumping
over the hurdles like this:</p>
<p><img alt="hurdles" src="_images/hurdles.png" /></p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Try it!</p>
<p>Write a program for the hurdle race.  Notice how often you repeat a certain
set of instructions.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have done that, select world <strong>Hurdles&nbsp;2</strong>: that&#8217;s an indoor race,
and therefore shorter. (It is also the one illustrated above.) You
should be able to remove a few lines of your program and have Reeborg
complete that race as well.</p>
<p>Once you are done with those races, you might want to try the unevenly
spaced hurdles of world <strong>Hurdles&nbsp;3</strong> or the highly irregular ones of world
<strong>Hurdles&nbsp;4</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="harvest-time">
<h2>8.6. Harvest time<a class="headerlink" href="#harvest-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reeborg has been gardening and it is time to harvest. Select world
<strong>Harvest&nbsp;1</strong>, <strong>Harvest&nbsp;2</strong> or <strong>Harvest&nbsp;3</strong> and have Reeborg collect all the
tokens which represent plants to harvest.</p>
<p>Notice how one can view the first worlds <strong>Harvest&nbsp;1</strong> and <strong>Harvest&nbsp;3</strong> as
having horizontal (or vertical) rows having the same length, while world
<strong>Harvest&nbsp;2</strong> can be seen as having diagonal rows having the same length.</p>
<p>Alternatively, select world <strong>Harvest&nbsp;4</strong> which occurred earlier in the
season. Reeborg had been planting some carrots; some sprouted fine,
others did not, while at some location 2 or more seeds sprouted. Reeborg
must remove the excess plants and reseed at locations where there are
missing ones so that each plant site has only one plant (token).</p>
<p><strong>You do not have to write a program this time.</strong>  Just think about how you
would do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stormy-weather">
<h2>8.7. Stormy weather<a class="headerlink" href="#stormy-weather" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a beautifully sunny day. Reeborg was playing outside with his
friend. Suddenly, it started to rain and Reeborg remembered that the
windows in his house were all open. So Reeborg went back to his house
and stopped in front of the door, unsure of how to proceed.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Try it!</p>
<p>Using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build_wall()</span></tt> instruction, help Reeborg close the windows
of his house. When Reeborg finishes his task, he will stand in the
doorway, watching the rain fall, waiting for it to stop before he can go
back and play outside. The world is <strong>Storm&nbsp;1</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reeborg-s-friend-s-turn">
<h3>8.7.1. Reeborg&#8217;s friend&#8217;s turn.<a class="headerlink" href="#reeborg-s-friend-s-turn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Erdna, Reeborg&#8217;s friend, lives in a bigger house as shown on <strong>Storm&nbsp;2</strong>.
Erdna was playing outside with Reeborg when it started raining. Help
Erdna close the windows in her house.</p>
<p>Later, you will be able to write a single program that will work for
both Reeborg and Erdna ... however, it will be a bit tricky.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="after-the-storm">
<h3>8.7.2. After the storm<a class="headerlink" href="#after-the-storm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The wind blew really hard last night. There is litter everywhere outside
Reeborg&#8217;s house. His parents asked him to go and clean up the path
leading to the curb, <strong>Storm&nbsp;3</strong>, as well as the driveway: <strong>Storm&nbsp;4</strong>.</p>
<p>Reeborg should collect all the litter, and put it in the garbage can,
and close the lid, using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build_wall()</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-yard-work">
<h3>8.7.3. More yard work!<a class="headerlink" href="#more-yard-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Reeborg&#8217;s parents are so proud of his work, that they ask him to pick up
all the garbage that got blown away in their backyard during the
windstorm, as illustrated on <strong>Storm&nbsp;5</strong>. Have Reeborg pick up all the
garbage and put it in the garbage can.</p>
<p>Later, you will learn to write a single program that can help Reeborg do
the cleanup for all three locations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>8.8. Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing programs that can solve the previous challenges can be quite
tedious as you have to write every single instruction that Reeborg must
follow. However, they are good exercises to make you think like a robot.
As you learn more about programming using Python, you will find ways
to write much shorter programs to solve these challenges.</p>
