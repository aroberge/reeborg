Introduction to OOP in Python with Reeborg
==========================================

As you know, Reeborg is in poor shape. 
It can only turn to its left, its compass is broken as
it can only be used to determine whether or not Reeborg is facing North.
Reeborg cannot turn its head left, so it cannot find out if there is
a wall to its left without turning its entire body.
Finally, it leaks oil which is bad for itself and the environment.

Using the power of Object-Oriented Programming, you will learn how to
fix Reeborg and how to give it additional capabilities.
