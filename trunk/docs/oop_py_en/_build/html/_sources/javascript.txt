Javascript
==========

Remember when you ran this code?

.. code-block:: py3

    r = UsedRobot()
    inspect(r)

We are going to do the equivalent with Javascript. 

At the very top of the Reeborg's World window, click to select
Javascript instead of Python.  Then run the following code:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var r = new UsedRobot();
   inspect(r);

If you look in the diary, you will see ``robot`` as we had in the
Python code, but will also see some familiar methods like
``at_goal()``, ``move()`` and many others.

Now we are ready to look at some code.

.. topic:: Do this!

   Execute the following Javascript code and look at the result
   in the Diary.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
       var r = new UsedRobot();
       view_source(r.turn_left);
       
   Make sure the code is exactly as written above.

.. important::

   You may have noticed that I usually do **not** show you the result of running
   these short programs.  One reason is that I occasionnally change the
   Javascript or the Python code powering Reeborg's World in order to
   add new features or fix bugs.  By looking at the code displayed in
   the Diary, you have access to my best code (so far) which may differ
   from the one that existed when I wrote this tutorial.  However, while
   there might be some differences between the two, it should be close 
   enough for you to figure out what is going with the help of this tutorial.

Based on the result that I see printed in Reeborg's Diary, my next guess
is to execute the following.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var r = new UsedRobot();
   view_source(RUR.control.turn_left);
   
After doing so, I see the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function (robot, no_frame){
       "use strict";
       robot._prev_orientation = robot.orientation;
       robot._prev_x = robot.x;
       robot._prev_y = robot.y;
       robot.orientation += 1;
       robot.orientation %= 4;
       if (no_frame) return;
       RUR.control.sound_id = "#turn-sound";
       RUR.rec.record_frame();
   }

As mentioned above, you might see something slightly different.
Here is the equivalent Python code::

   def (robot, no_frame):
       robot._prev_orientation = robot.orientation
       robot._prev_x = robot.x
       robot._prev_y = robot.y
       robot.orientation += 1
       robot.orientation %= 4
       if no_frame:
           return
       RUR.control.sound_id = "#turn-sound"
       RUR.rec.record_frame()

We will come back to this code sample later; for now, remember that we were
talking about "recording frames" ... It looks as though the last instruction
is the one we were looking for.  Time to go back to coding in Python.
Select Python as the programming language at the top of Reeborg's World window
