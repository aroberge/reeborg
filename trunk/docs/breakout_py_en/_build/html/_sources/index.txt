Breakout: Making a simple game with Python
==========================================

**Prerequisite:** you should have gone through the short
`Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python <../oop_py_en/>`_
before reading this tutorial.

Open `the game world environment <../../game.html>`_  in a separate tab
or browser window and follow along the instructions given in this tutorial 
to learn how to make your own game.   This tutorial is inspired from 
`Bill Mill's canvas tutorial <http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/index.html>`_.

If you have both Firefox and Chrome, you may find it useful to open the 
`the game world environment <../../game.html>`_ in each browser.
In one browser, you could write the code the way I do it in this tutorial.
In the other, you could write your own version, perhaps adding different
features, or doing things differently.

Reeborg's World saves the state of your code on **your** computer 
using the "Local Storage" of your browser.  Having two different browsers
open enable you to work with two different versions of the code.
You don't have to do this, of course: a single browser with two tabs, one 
for this tutorial and one for the game world environment, is sufficient
to go through this tutorial.

Have fun!
