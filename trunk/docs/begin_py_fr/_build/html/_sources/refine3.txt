Refinements: part 3
===================

As you should have noticed the program doesn't work. What happens is
that Reeborg gets in an infinite loop when there is no wall around him.
We need to have him ``move()`` after turning right, as indicated below::

    put("token");
    move();
    while ( !token_here() ){
        if (right_is_clear()){
            turn_right();
            move();
        } else if (front_is_clear()){
            move();
        } else {
            turn_left();
        }
    }

More complicated world

    Now, consider **AroundÂ 3**; will our program work?

As you probably guessed, unfortunately the answer is no. Try to figure
out why before reading any further.
