Test driven learning
====================

In order to help you learn Javascript, I will give you some tests: you
have to program Reeborg to accomplish specific tasks and Reeborg itself
will tell you if you got it right or wrong.

Select the world **Home 1**. Notice how the bottom left square is coloured
differently: this is Reeborg's home. Reeborg's world is a simple grid.
In **Home 1**, Reeborg starts at the third square on the bottom row. It
labels this square as ``x=3`` and ``y=1``, using what is known as
Cartesian coordinates.

.. topic:: Try this!

    With **Home 1** selected, write a program with a single ``move()`` instruction, 
    run it and notice what feedback Reeborg gives you.  
    Then, change your program so that
    Reeborg go home.

.. topic:: Try two more!

    Select **Home 2**. Notice how Reeborg is in a different location and is also
    facing you. Try running the exact same program and see what happens.

    Next, select **Home 3**. Notice how there is a small black square in the
    home position. Try to run your program now.


Making a left turn
------------------

Last example ended with a program that did not quite work: something
about Reeborg not being in the right orientation. If you look at the
green home square, you will notice a small black square on its right
edge: this is the direction Reeborg should be facing. In order to do so,
we must add one more instruction to the program::

    turn_left();

.. topic:: Try this!

    Make sure that Reeborg goes home in **Home 3**.

.. topic:: Try something else!

    What happens if, instead of using ``turn_left();``, you use instead a
    third ``move();`` instruction?

A different view
----------------

.. |image0| image:: ../../src/images/robot_e.png
.. |image1| image:: ../../src/images/rover_e.png

You may have noticed that Reeborg (the robot itself) is seen from its
side, such as |image0| whereas his world is seen from above ... which
you might perhaps find confusing especially when you instruct Reeborg to
turn left. You can change the way Reeborg is seen by either using the
clicking on the appropriate image below Reeborg's world.
For example, when facing East, such as the side view above, using a different
image, Reeborg can appear as follows when viewed from above: |image1|
