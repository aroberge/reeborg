Rule number 3
=============

By now, you should be ready to learn about the third rule for writing
computer programs efficiently.

.. important::

    **Rule # 3**
        When writing computer programs, do not repeat yourself.
        I repeat: **do not repeat yourself!**

Three lefts can make a right
----------------------------

Since you have written quite a few programs by now (you have done the
exercises, didn't you?), you must have realized that having Reeborg make
three left turns in a row gives the same final result as if he were to
make a single right turn. You are probably starting to find it quite
tedious to have to write three ``turn_left();`` instructions each time
you want to have Reeborg turn right. Wouldn't it be nicer if you could
simply write ``turn_right();``?

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to do just that.

Defining functions
------------------

What we have called *instructions* or *commands* so far are examples of
Javascript **functions**. So, ``turn_left()`` is a function and so is
``move()``. We can define a new Javascript function as follows::

    function some_well_chosen_name () {
        // some lines of code ...
    }

``function`` is our second Javascript **keyword**. 
Notice how the, curly braces ``{ }`` surround what
is known as a *block of code* and constitutes the *body* of the
function. It is customary to *indent* such blocks of code to make it
easier to identify the function body, rather than simply relying on
spotting the curly braces.

Let's write our first Javascript function::

    function turn_right () {
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
    }

That's it! You will now be able to avoid having to write three
``turn_left()`` functions in a row to simulate a right turn!

.. topic:: Try it!

    Define the ``turn_right()`` function in a program and try to use it,
    perhaps using the world Alone. If you don't know what to try, just have
    Reeborg go around a square by alternating ``turn_right()`` and
    ``move()`` **functions** four times in a row.

How to think about ``function``
-------------------------------

.. note::

   Please note that this simplified explanation does not take into account what is known
   as *variable scope* which is something that we will cover later.

You have just seen how to define a function in Javascript. Chances are,
you understood right away how to think about them but, just in case,
here's a more detailed explanation which will help you to not only
understand how functions work, but also other Javascript construct that
involve blocks of code.

Suppose we have the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 8

    function turn_right () {  // begin of code block
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
    }  // end of code block

    move();
    turn_right();
    move();

This is equivalent to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 10, 11, 12

    // define a function
    function turn_right () {
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
        turn_left();
    }

    move();
    // begin of code block inside turn_right()
    turn_left();
    turn_left();
    turn_left();
    // end of code block
    move();

In other words, ``function`` defines a name that we can use as a synonym
for all the code that appears inside the code block, and whenever we see
the synonym being **called** [that is, the name appears followed by
``()``], we can think of it as being equivalent to inserting the code
block *as is* at that location.

.. topic:: Try this!

   See if you can simplify your program for the newspaper delivery
   and making it easier to read and understand
   by using a ``turn_right()`` function.  Once you have done so, perhaps
   you can think of other ways in which you can simplify your program by
   defining other functions.
