<h1>Introduction to the challenges</h1>
<p>In the next few lessons, you will be presented some challenges.
What you have to do, is to write programs that accomplish what is being described as being Reeborg's task.
<b>You do not have to do all the challenges.</b>  The idea at this point is to get familiar with the way that
Reeborg moves and to identify patterns that reoccur when finding a given solution.</p>
<p>While you write your programs, each of which will consist of a specific of series of instructions,
you have the advantage of seeing the entire world all at once.  You should think of how Reeborg,
who only sees the grid square where he is located, could take advantage of clues to determine its
next action.</p>
