<h1>Surprises</h1>
<p>Change the program we just wrote to remove the <code>put_token()</code>
instruction.  After saving it, try this slightly modified program
with the following hurdle race (file: hurdles3.wld).</p>

<p>Surprise! Other than finishing facing in an unusual direction (perhaps
bowing to the crowd after winning), the program we just wrote can solve the
hurdle problem. It also works with the uneven hurdle (file: hurdles4.wld)
illustrated below - which the program we wrote before for jumping over
hurdles could not handle!</p>

<p>Try the same modified program again with the maze
problem we introduced in one of the first lessons (file: maze1.wld),
as illustrated below.</p>

<p>As you will see, our simple program can find the exit to this maze!
Amazing!</p>
