<h1>Surprises</h1>
<p>Change the program we just wrote to remove the <code>put_token()</code>
instruction.  Then try this slightly modified program
with the following hurdle races <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;1</span>,
<span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;2</span> and <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;3</span>.
You will find that this program, which is quite different than the ones you had
written before, works just as well.</p>

<p>Now, try it with <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;4</span>. Surprise! It
works whereas the previous program did not!</p>

<p>Try the same modified program again with either <span class="world">Maze&nbsp;1</span>
or <span class="world">Maze&nbsp;2</span>.</p>

<p>As you will see, this simple program can find the exit to this maze!</p>
<p>Amazing!</p>
