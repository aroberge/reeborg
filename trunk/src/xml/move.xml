<h1>First program</h1>
<p>In the second panel, notice a drop-down list with
    <b>Select a world</b>
    written.  Click on it and select <span class="world">Alone</span>; you will see Reeborg appear
    in the world, in the bottom left corner, as well as some buttons
    on the top.</p>
    <p><small>You might have to minimize this window, or move it to the left in
        order to see Reeborg.</small></p>
<p>Click on <b>Execute</b> and watch what happens.</p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You had Reeborg take its first steps.  In the editor panel, there is a single instruction:</p>
<pre class="jscode">move();</pre>
<p>That is the command that Reeborg executed. Notice how the "Execute" button
is now disabled; click on "Reload" to enable it again, and try to run it again. By the way,
a synonym for Execute is Run (as in, run a program).
When you are ready, <b>move</b> to the next lesson.</p>
