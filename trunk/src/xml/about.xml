<p>Inspired by Guido van Robot, itself inspired by the original Karel the Robot
created by Richard Pattis, Reeborg first appeared in RUR-PLE, a program I created
to teach myself programming as a hobby.</p>
<p>Reeborg is there to guide you in learning computer programming in Javascript.
Why Javascript?   The main reason is because it is the native language
for programming web browsers.  Since Reeborg's program is written in Javascript,
you will be able, after going through enough lessons, to change the way that
Reeborg behaves, using the full power of Javascript and perhaps make
Reeborg do things that I never thought could be possible.<p>
<p> I hope you enjoy learning computer programming with Reeborg.
