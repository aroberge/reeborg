<p>Inspired by Guido van Robot, itself inspired by the original Karel the Robot
created by Richard Pattis, Reeborg first appeared in RUR-PLE, a program I created
to teach myself programming as a hobby.</p>
<p>Reeborg is there to guide you in learning computer programming in Javascript.
Why Javascript?   The main reason is because it is the native language
for programming web browsers.  Since Reeborg's program is written in Javascript,
you will be able, after going through enough lessons, to change the way that
Reeborg behaves, using the full power of Javascript and perhaps make
Reeborg do things that I never thought could be possible.<p>
<p> I hope you enjoy learning computer programming with Reeborg.

If you are using it to teach Javascript to students, you might want to make
    a copy of this site on a local server; contact me if you need help.</p>
<p>If you find this site so useful and you want to do something to thank me,
    you have two choices:</p>
    <ul><li>You can give me $100,000; small denominations preferred.</li>
    <li>You can <em>pay it forward</em> by doing something nice to someone else,
    ideally letting them know about this site.</li></ul>
    <p>The choice is yours :-)</p>
