<h1>Refinements: part 4</h1>
<p>As you most likely found out, we were too hasty in asking Reeborg to move
forward after putting down a beeper. We need to check if there is a wall
preventing him from moving first. Here's a solution to the problem.</p>
<pre class="jscode">
put_token();
if ( !front_is_clear() ) {
    turn_left();
}
move();
while ( !token_here() ){
    if (right_is_clear()){
        turn_right();
        move();
    } else if (front_is_clear()){
        move();
    } else {
        turn_left();
    }
}</pre>

<p>Test it now and see that it works. Can you imagine situations where it
might not work?</p>
