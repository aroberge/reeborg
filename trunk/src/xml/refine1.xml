<h1>Refinements: part 1</h1>
<p>In this multi-part lesson, we are going to write a complete program to
solve problems of increasing complexity.  For each lesson,
I will present a tentative solution that will contain one mistake.
Try to find it before moving on to the next lesson.</p>

<h2>A simple problem</h2>
<p>Let us start by considering a simple problem: having Reeborg go around his
world <b>once</b> and stop when it is back at its starting point. In concrete terms,
select world <span class="world">Around&nbsp;1</span>. We have done something like this
before, when we introduced the <code>front_is_clear()</code> test. Here's the
outline of a solution which supposes that Reeborg carries at least one beeper
at the beginning:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Put down a token to mark the starting (and ending) point.</li>
    <li> Move forward until facing a wall.</li>
    <li> Turn left when facing a wall.</li>
    <li> Repeat steps 2 and 3 until we find the token we had put down.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take you time to think about the above algorithm. Then, consider
this solution in code. </p>
<pre class="jscode">
put_token();
while ( !token_here() ){
    if (front_is_clear()){
        move();
    } else {
        turn_left();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Take the time to think about what the above program instructs Reeborg to
do before trying to run it. Can you find a problem with the proposed solution?</p>
