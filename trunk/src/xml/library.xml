<h1>Using the Library</h1>
<p>When programmer make use of a given function in different programs,
rather than redefining it in each program, they put them in special
programs called <b>libraries</b> and they have a way to ensure that
their other programs can use the functions that are found in
the library.</p>
<p>You are going to use the function <code>turn_right()</code> <b>a lot!</b>.
Instead of rewriting it each time (remember Rule # 3), what you are going to
do is to write it <b>once</b> (<small>more</small>) but, this time,
instead of writing it in the editor with the <b>Code</b> tab, you will
click on the <b>Library</b> tab and write it there.  Oh, and you should
also write <code>turn_around()</code> there as well.  Once you have done
this, you need to do two things.</p>
<ol><li>Click on <b>save</b> so that it will be available for you
anytime you come back to Reeborg's world. (I don't expect you to go
through all the lessons in one single visit.)</li>
<li>Write a short program that uses them to make sure that they
work as expected.  If they don't, fix them ... <b>and save the version
that works properly</b> by clicking on <b>save</b> again.</li></ol>
<p>From now on, whenever you define a function that you use more than
once, add it to your library so that you don't have to redefine it
every time.</p>
