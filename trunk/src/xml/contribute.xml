<p> I am just a self-taught programmer, with no training in web design, graphics, etc.
I would gladly welcome any suggestions or contributions to</p>
<ul><li>Improve the usability of this site.</li>
<li>Make a better looking robot; I drew Reeborg pixel-by-pixel using a rather primitive
    drawing program, suitable for my skills level. Note that Reeborg is viewed sideways where its
world is (most often) viewed from above; a nicer-looking Reeborg, perhaps viewed
from nearly above, might be most welcome.</li>
<li>New worlds, examples and challenges.</li>
<li>Corrections to the existing content, including fixing typos.</li>
<li>etc.</li></ul>
