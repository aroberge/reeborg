<p> I am just a self-taught programmer, with no training in web design, graphics, etc.
I would gladly welcome any suggestions or contributions to</p>
<ul><li>Improve the usability of this site.</li>
<li>Make a better looking robot; I drew Reeborg pixel-by-pixel using a rather primitive
    drawing program, suitable for my skills level. Note that Reeborg is viewed sideways where its
world is (most often) viewed from above; a nicer-looking Reeborg, perhaps viewed
from nearly above, might be most welcome.</li>
<li>New worlds, examples and challenges.</li>
<li>Corrections to the existing content, including fixing typos.</li>
<li>etc.</li></ul>
<p>My medium-term plans include:</p>
<ul><li>Translating the Javascript-based tutorial into French</li>
<li>Having a Python version (probably using <a href="http://brython.info/index.html">Brython</a>)</li>
<li>Having a CoffeeScript version</li>
<li>Tutorial on games using the html canvas</li></ul>
<p>Longer term plans include:</p>
<ul><li>Implementing Reeborg's world for other languages (Scheme, ...) as long as it can be
done within a browser with no server-side code running.</li>
<li>Investigating something like <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior">Ruby-warrior in javascript</a></li>
<li>Investigating the possibility of porting <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">From nand to Tetris</a> to the web using Javascript</li></ul>
