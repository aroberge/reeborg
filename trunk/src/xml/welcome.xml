<h1>Welcome to Reeborg's world</h1>
<p>Before you learn how to program, you should become familiar
with Reeborg's world and its surroundings.</p>
<p>This text appears in the <b>Contents</b> window; you can resize it,
move it, minimize it or close it.  If you do close it, you can always
reopen it by clicking on the
<b>Contents</b> button at the very top. </p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Moving along...</h2>
<p>Make this window smaller and move it downwards and to the right.</p>
<p>The panel on the right is the <b>Editor</b> panel, where you will write the
programs that Reeborg will execute.  It will do so in the second panel, known
as the <b>World</b> panel, and located to the left, below the initial position
of the <b>Contents</b> window.  A third panel, Reeborg's <b>Diary</b> can also be
open from a button on the top.</p>
<p>Try opening and closing the various panels or resize them just to get a feel
of how you can rearrange the environment.</p>
<h2>Suggestion</h2>
<p>Personnally, I find it
very convenient to make the position this <b>Contents</b> window such that the title bar
is just below the buttons on the world panel (you may have to make this window
slightly smaller depending on the size of your screen) and use the
minimize "button" ( "_" on the title bar) to hide the content when
I try running some programs and click on it again when I want to read
the lessons.</p>

<p>Once you're satisfied with your exploration, click on the
<b>Next</b> button, either near the top or bottom of this <b>Contents</b> window, to
go to the next lesson, where you will have Reeborg take its
first step.</p>
