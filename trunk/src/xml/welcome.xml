<h1>Welcome to Reeborg's world</h1>
<p>Before you learn how to program, you should become familiar
with Reeborg's world and its surroundings.</p>
<p>This text appears in the <b>Content</b> <em>panel</em>; you can resize it
horizontally by "grabbing" its right edge with your mouse.
You can also make it disappear, or reappear, by clicking on the
<b>Content</b> button at the very top. </p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Moving along...</h2>
<p>The panel to the right of this one is the <b>Editor</b> panel, where you will write the
programs that Reeborg will execute.  It will do so in the third panel, known
as the <b>World</b> panel.</p>
<p>Try resizing the various panels and making them disappear and reappear
by pressing the various buttons at the top, just to get a feel
of how you can rearrange the environment.</p>
<p>Once you're satisfied with your exploration, click on the
<b>Next</b> button, either at the top or bottom of this <b>Content</b> panel, to
go to the next lesson, where you will have Reeborg take its
first steps.</p>
