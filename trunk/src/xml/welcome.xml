<h1>Welcome to Reeborg's world</h1>
<p>Before you learn how to program, you should become familiar
with Reeborg's world and its surroundings.</p>
<p>This text appears in the <b>Contents</b> <em>window</em>; you can resize it,
move it, minimize it or close it.  If you do close it, you can always
reopen it by clicking on the
<b>Contents</b> button at the very top. </p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Moving along...</h2>
<p>The panel on the left is the <b>Editor</b> panel, where you will write the
programs that Reeborg will execute.  It will do so in the second panel, known
as the <b>World</b> panel.  A third panel, Reeborg's <b>Diary</b> can also be
open from a button on the top.</p>
<p>Try opening and closing the various panels or resize them just to get a feel
of how you can rearrange the environment.</p>
<p>Once you're satisfied with your exploration, click on the
<b>Next</b> button, either at the top or bottom of this window, to
go to the next lesson, where you will have Reeborg take its
first steps.</p>
