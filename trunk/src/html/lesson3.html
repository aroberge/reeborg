<h1>Dealing with eRRoRs</h1>
<p>Change <b>move();</b> to <b>Move();</b> (with an uppercase M) and
try to execute the program.</p>
<p>Click on "Execute" and watch what happens.</p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>Javascript, the language that Reeborg understands, is "case sensitive"; that is,
lowercase letters have a different meanings than uppercase ones.  So, go back, fix
the program and run the corrected version.</p>
<p>Once you have run it successfully, all previous indications that something
    was wrong with the program will have disappeared.  So, make sure that this
    is the case.</p>
<p>Now, delete the semi-colon (;) at the end of the "move()" instruction
    and run the program again.   You will find that Reeborg complains that
    there is a missing semi-colon but nonetheless understands enough
    to do what you expect it to do.  Missing semi-colons can sometimes cause
    Reeborg to misunderstand your intentions; so make sure to include them
    when Reeborg complains even if Reeborg appears to do the right thing.</p>
