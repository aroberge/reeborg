<h1>First program</h1>
<p>In the third panel, notice a drop-down list with
    <span class="world">Select a world</span>
    written.  Click on it and select "Alone"; you will see Reeborg appear
    in the world, in the bottom left corner, as well as some buttons
    on the top.</p>
<p>Click on "Execute" and watch what happens.</p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You had Reeborg take its first steps.  In the center panel, there is a single instruction:</p>
<pre class="jscode">move();</pre>
<p>That is the command that Reeborg executed. Notice how the "Execute" button
is now disabled; click on "Reload" to enable it again, and try to run it again. By the way,
a synonym for Execute is Run (as in, run a program).
When you are ready, <b>move</b> to the next lesson.</p>
