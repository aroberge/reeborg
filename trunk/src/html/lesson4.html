<h1>Test driven learning</h1>
<p>In order to help you learn Javascript, I will give you some tests: you have
to program Reeborg to accomplish specific tasks and Reeborg itself will tell you
if you got it right or wrong.</p>
<p>Select the world "Home 1".  Notice how the bottom left square is coloured differently: this
is Reeborg's home.  Reeborg's world is a simple grid.  In "Home 1", Reeborg starts at
the third square on the bottom row.  It labels this square as "x=3" and "y=1", using what is
known as Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>In the Code editor, there is a program with a single command: "move();".
    Try running the program and see what Reeborg has to say about the result.</p>

<h2>Fix it!</h2>
<p>Can you add a second line to the program so that Reeborg can go home?</p>
<h2>Try two more</h2>
<p>Select "Home 2".  Notice how Reeborg is in a different location and is also facing you.
Try running the exact same program and see what happens.</p>
<p>Next, select "Home 3".  Notice how there is a small black square in the  home position.
Try to run your program now.</p>
