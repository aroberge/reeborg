<h1>Lost in a maze</h1>
<p>Reeborg is lost in a maze. Have a look at the worlds <span class="world">Maze&nbsp;1</span> and
<span class="world">Maze&nbsp;2</span>. In each case, write a program that leads Reeborg to the exit.</p>
<p>Later, you will be able to write a single program that will have Reeborg
get out of both mazes, and could in fact help him get out of almost any maze you could think of.</p>
