<h1>Listen to me ... or else ....</h1>
<p>While learning how to program may be fun, you should not spend all your
time in front of the computer. <code>if</code> it rains, keep reading, otherwise,
go outside and play! (Yes, even you grandpa!)</p>
<h2>Two choices...</h2>
<p>Let's rewrite the sentence that starts with <code>if</code> above.</p>
<pre class="jscode">if it rains,
    keep reading,
otherwise,
    go outside and play</pre>
<p>If this were Javascript, we might have written it like this instead:</p>'
<pre class="jscode">if ( it_rains() ) {
    keep_reading();
} else {
    go_outside_and_play();
}</pre>
<p>Yes, Javascript includes the possibility of more than one choice with the keyword <code>else</code>.
Let's use it with another example.  Reeborg can see if there's a wall right in front
him. Consider world <span class="world">Around&nbsp;1</span>.
You will use a new condition, <code>front_is_clear()</code> which Reeborg uses
to determine if there's a wall in front of him or not, together with the <code>if/else</code>
pair to write a program that will guide Reeborg around the world.  Something like the
following:</p>
<pre class="jscode">
function move_or_turn () {
    if ( front_is_clear() ) {
        // something
    } else {
        // something else
    }
}

repeat(move_or_turn, 40);</pre>

<h2>Try it!</h2>

<p>After you are done, can you modify the program (by adding one line) so that Reeborg
deposits a token at each corner?</p>

<h2>How to think about <code>if/else</code></h2>
<p>We have seen how <code>function</code>s and <code>if</code> statements
could be thought of as being (sometimes) equivalent to inserting a code
block; the exception was when the condition of the <code>if</code> statement
was <code>false</code>, in which case we ignored the code
block which is equivalent to deleting it.  <code>if/else</code> statements
can be thought as inserting one or the other code block.  Thus</p>
<pre class="jscode">
move();
if ( true ) {
    turn_right();
} else {
    turn_left();
}
move();</pre>
<p>is equivalent to </p>
<pre class="jscode">
move();
turn_right();
move();</pre>
<p>whereas</p>
<pre class="jscode">
move();
if ( false ) {
    turn_right();
} else {
    turn_left();
}
move();</pre>
<p>is equivalent to </p>
<pre class="jscode">
move();
turn_left();
move();</pre>
