<h1>Rock, paper, scissors</h1>

<p>You probably already know the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper,
and paper beats rock.  Let's implement a Javascript version of it and learn three
new keywords:  <code>switch</code>, <code>case</code>, and <code>default</code>.
We will also learn about the logical operators <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code></p>

<p>This game is played with two players; however we'll just take
one of the players to be the computer so that you can play against it by yourself.
Also, we'll just give the code for one round of the game; it will be up to you
to implement a multiple game round with a <code>while</code> loop, using the
number guessing game as an example.</p>
<p>Starting with the computer player, we use the random number generator
to make one of the three possible choices:</p>
<pre class="jscode">function computer_select () {
    var selection = Math.random();  // number between 0. and 1.0
    if (selection < 1/3) {
        return "rock";
    } else if (selection < 2/3 ) {
        return "paper";
    } else {
        return "scissors";
    }
}</pre>

<p>You may want to try the above code by running the following test program</p>
<pre class="jscode">for( var i=0; i < 25; i++) {
write( i + " " + computer_select() );
}</pre>
<p>before moving to the next lesson to learn about logical operators.</p>
