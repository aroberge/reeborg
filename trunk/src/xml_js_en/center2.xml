<h1>Finding the center</h1>
<p>Have a look at the worlds <span class="world">Center&nbsp;1</span> to
<span class="world">Center&nbsp;3</span>. Write a <b>single</b> program that has
Reeborg put a token at the geometric center of the rectangular room he finds himself in.</p>
<p>Hint: you may find it useful to have Reeborg, who carries more tokens than he might ever need,
make a line with tokens at each location.  Then,
by picking one token at one end, then at the other end, going back and forth until the last token
is taken, the location of the center can be found.  When you know how to do this in one dimension
(along a horizontal line), you can use that location as the starting point to find the location
along the other location (a vertical line).</p>
