<h1>Surprises</h1>
<p>Change the program we just wrote so that </p>
<pre class="jscode">mark_starting_point_and_move();

while ( !found_starting_point() ){
    follow_right_wall();
}</pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre class="jscode">
while ( !at_goal() ){
    follow_right_wall();
}</pre>
<p>and run this program
with the following hurdle races <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;1</span>,
<span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;2</span> and <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;3</span>.
You will find that this program, which is quite different than the ones you had
written before to solve the hurdles challenges, works just as well.
</p>

<p>Now, try it with <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;4</span>. Surprise! It
works whereas the previous program did not!</p>

<p>Try the same modified program again with either <span class="world">Maze&nbsp;1</span>
or <span class="world">Maze&nbsp;2</span>.</p>

<p>As you will see, this simple program can find the exit to this maze!</p>
<p>Amazing!</p>
