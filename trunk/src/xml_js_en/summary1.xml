<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>It is time to review what you have learned so far.
In addition to getting familiar with the environment on this site, you
have learned the first two rules for learning about programming. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Rule # 1</b></dt>
<dd>Learning about computer programming is like learning to play
a musical instrument: you have to <b>do it</b>, not simply read
about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Rule # 2</b></dt>
<dd>Write your computer programs to make them easy for
<b><em>people</em></b> to read and understand.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Related to Rule # 2, we have seen how we can include <em>comments</em> as
a mean to communicate some information to other humans, information that
will be ignored by the computer.</p>

<p>While I have not mentioned this explicitly, you have also learned that a program is a series of instructions. You have seen a total of 5 different instructions:</p>
<ul><li><code>move();</code></li>
<li><code>turn_left();</code></li>
<li><code>take();</code> equivalent to <code>take("token");</code></li>
<li><code>put();</code> equivalent to <code>put("token");</code></li>
<li><code>pause();</code></li></ul>
<p>You may or may not have used the <code>pause()</code> instruction which I
only mentioned in passing when talking about bugs. If you have not done so,
 you might want to write a short
program that includes it just to see what happens; make sure that the <code>pause()</code>
instruction is neither the first nor the last one so that you can plainly see what it does.</p>
