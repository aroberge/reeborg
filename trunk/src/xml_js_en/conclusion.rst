More Javascript
===============

In this section, we have seen a few more Javascript keywords as well as
mathematical operations. There are many more mathematical operations in
Javascript. We suggest that you read through `Expressions and
Operators <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators>`__
on the `Mozilla Developer
Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>`__ resources to find out
more about the available operators before learning about Object Oriented
Programming in the next section.
