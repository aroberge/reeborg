<h1>Refinements: part 2</h1>
<p>Here's the cause of the problem we had at the end of part 1: we put down a
token and, before we had the chance to move, tested to see if we were not
next to a token. Since we were next to a token,
we never go the chance to get in the <code>while</code> loop.
Perhaps we can change the
program to add a <code>move()</code> before we start the loop, as follows:</p>
<pre class="jscode">
put("token");
move();
while ( !token_here() ){
    if (front_is_clear()){
        move();
    } else {
        turn_left();
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Try it!</b></p>
<h2>Not so simple world</h2>
<p>Let's try the program we wrote on a slightly more complicated world
    <span class="world">Around&nbsp;2</span>.</p>
<p>When you try your program, you will see that the result is not exactly
what we wanted: Reeborg takes a shortcut, and
doesn't go all the way around.
The problem is that we assumed that Reeborg only had to move forward or
turn left to go around the world; we never took into account situations where
we would have wanted him to make a right turn. What Reeborg needs to do is
first to check on his right to see if there is still a wall; if not, we have
him make a right turn. Here's a modified program that <i>attempts</i>
to do just that:</p>
<pre class="jscode">
put("token");
move();
while ( !token_here() ){
    if (right_is_clear()){
        turn_right();
    } else if (front_is_clear()){
        move();
    } else {
        turn_left();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Does it work? Read it carefully to decide for yourself. Then try it to
confirm your opinion by running the program, or make any change you think appropriate.</p>
