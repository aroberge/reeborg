<h1>Rule number 1</h1>

<p>Did you try all that I suggested to you in the previous lesson?  If not,
I urge you to go back to do it.  You see, the most important rule you
must follow if you wish to learn programming is the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Rule # 1</b></dt>
<dd>Learning about computer programming is like learning to play
a musical instrument: you have to <b>do it</b>, not simply read
about it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Every time I suggest you try something, I have a reason for doing
so.  Sometimes it will not be apparent right away, but I really encourage
you to try it.  I would even suggest to you that you should do more
than what I suggest and try different things just to explore further.</p>
