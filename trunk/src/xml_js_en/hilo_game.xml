<h1>Guess a number: the game!</h1>

<p>We now know everything we need to write the program for a number guessing game.
Here's the outline of our program in words:</p>
<p><em>After asking the player his or her name, we will ask them if they want to play.
If they do, we will generate a random number and ask the player to guess it. If the
player guesses a number too high, we will indicate it and ask to guess again; we'll
do the same thing if the guess is too low.  If the answer is right, we indicate so
and ask the player if they want to play again.</em></p>
<p>Each time a new game is started, we will have a loop until the right number is guessed.
Similarly, we will have a loop enabling us to restart a new game.</p>
<p>I have written the code for you, replacing most variable names (introduced on
the first line) by <code>*****</code>. Rewrite this code with the correct variable
names and start playing!</p>

<pre class="jscode">var answer, guess, player_name, play_game=true;

***** = prompt("What is your name?");
***** = confirm("Hello " + ***** + "!  Let's play a game!");
while(*****) {
    answer = Math.floor(Math.random()*100) + 1;
    ***** = parseInt(prompt("Choose a number between 1 and 100."), 10);

    while (***** !== answer) {
        if (***** < *****) {
            guess = parseInt(prompt(guess + " is too low; guess again."), 10);
        }
        else {
            ***** = parseInt(prompt(***** + " is too high; guess again."), 10);
        }
    }

    ***** = confirm(***** + " is the answer!\n Play again?");
}

alert("Goodbye " + *****);
