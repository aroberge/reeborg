<h1>Jumping over hurdles</h1>
<p>Reeborg has entered a race. It's the 110 meters hurdles race, in preparation for the Olympics.
Have a look at the world <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;1</span> and
have Reeborg complete the race, staying as low as he can, just jumping over the hurdles like this: <br>
<img src="src/images/hurdles.png" alt="hurdles"/>
</p>
<p>
Once you have done that, select world <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;2</span>: that's an indoor
race, and therefore shorter. (<small>It is also the one illustrated above</small>.)  You should be able to remove a few lines of your program and have
Reeborg complete that race as well.</p>
<p>Once you are done with those races, you might want to try the unevenly spaced hurdles of
    world <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;3</span> or the highly irregular ones of world
    <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;4</span>.</p>
