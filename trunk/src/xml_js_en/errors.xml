<h1>Dealing with eRRoRs</h1>
<p>Change <code>move();</code> to <code>Move();</code> (with an uppercase M) and
try to execute the program.</p>
<p>Click on {execute_button} and watch what happens.</p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>Javascript, the language that Reeborg understands, is "case sensitive"; that is,
lowercase letters have a different meanings than uppercase ones.  So, go back, fix
the program and run the corrected version.</p>
<p>Once you have run it successfully, all previous indications that something
    was wrong with the program will have disappeared.  So, make sure that this
    is the case.</p>
<p>Now, delete the semi-colon (;) at the end of the <code>move()</code> instruction
    and run the program again.   You will find that Reeborg complains that
    there is a missing semi-colon but nonetheless understands enough
    to do what you expect it to do.  Missing semi-colons can sometimes cause
    Reeborg to misunderstand your intentions; so make sure to include them
    when Reeborg complains even if Reeborg appears to be doing the right thing.</p>
