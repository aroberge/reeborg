<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In this section, we have seen our third rule: </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Rule # 3</b></dt>
<dd>When writing computer programs, do not repeat yourself.<br>
I repeat: <b>do not repeat yourself!</b></dd>
</dl>


<p>We have also learned how to define functions by using our very first Javascript
keyword: <code>function</code>, as well as the special function <code>repeat()</code>.
We have also seen how we could define new words for existing functions using
the Javascript keyword <code>var</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we have learned that we could save functions in the Library so
that we can use them without having to redefine them each time.</p>
