<h1>Re-introduction to some challenges</h1>
<p>It is time to solve some of the challenges introduced early on.</p>
<p>Using <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, etc., you will write programs that
will be able to accomplish various tasks.  In writing these programs, you should keep the following
in mind:</p>
<ol><li>Remember rule #2 and choose names that are descriptive for the problems you are attempting to solve</li>
<li>Follow the principles given in rule #4: start by solving simpler problems first and generalize your
solution so that it can be applied to more than one problem</li>
<li>Remember rule #3: avoid repeating code as much as possible. </li></ol>
<p>Now, remember rule #1 ... and make sure that, this time, you solve <b>all</b> the challenges described
in the next few lessons.</p>
