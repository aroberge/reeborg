<h1>Welcome to Reeborg's world</h1>
<p>Before you learn how to program, you should become familiar
with Reeborg's world and its surroundings.</p>
<p>This text appears in the <b>Contents</b> window; you can resize it,
move it, minimize it or close it.  If you do close it, you can always
reopen it by clicking on the
<b>Contents</b> button at the very top. </p>
<p>Try it!</p>

<h2>Moving along...</h2>
<p>Make this window smaller and move it downwards and to the right.</p>
<p>The panel on the right is the <b>Editor</b> panel, where you will write the
programs that Reeborg will execute.  It will do so in the first panel, known
as the <b>World</b> panel.  A third panel, Reeborg's <b>Diary</b> can also be
opened from a button on the top.</p>
<p>Try opening and closing the various panels or resize them just to get a feel
of how you can rearrange the environment.</p>
<h2>Suggestion</h2>
<p>Personally, I find it
very convenient to make the position this <b>Contents</b> window such that its title bar
is just below the main title bar and located above Reeborg's world
(which should be its starting position), and use the
minimize "button" ( "-" on the title bar) to hide the content when
I try running some programs, clicking on it again to maximize it when I want to read
the lessons.</p>

<p>Once you're satisfied with your exploration, click on the
<b>Next</b> button, either near the top or bottom of this <b>Contents</b> window, to
go to the next lesson, where you will have Reeborg take its
first step.</p>
