<h1>Repeat</h1>

<p>Often, we will find that we want to repeat a series of instructions a fixed number of times.
There is a way in Javascript to do so ... but it has too many new concepts to explain at this
time.   I will just show you the code, and immediately introduce <code>repeat()</code>,
a simpler replacement for it.  Later, when you know more about Javascript, I will explain how
<code>repeat()</code> is defined in terms of the standard way.  The standard
way is known as a <b>for loop</b> and is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="jscode">for (var i = 0; i < n; i++){
    // some instructions here
}</pre>
<p>Now that you have seen this cryptic code which includes two Javascript keywords,
<code>for</code> and <code>var</code>, let's introduce instead <code>repeat()</code>.
We will use the example <code>get_money()</code> from the previous newspaper delivery example:</p>

<pre class="jscode">
function get_money() {
    take("token");
    take("token");
    take("token");
    take("token");
    take("token");
}</pre>
<p>Inside <code>get_money()</code>, we repeat 5 times the command <code>take("token")</code>.
Using <code>repeat()</code>, we can rewrite the above as follows:</p>
<pre class="jscode">
function get_money() {
    repeat(take_token, 5);
}</pre>
<p>Note that I have <b>not</b> included the parentheses <code>()</code> for <code>take_token</code>
inside <code>repeat()</code>.  Using <code>repeat()</code> we have yet another way to
eliminate repetitions in our code.  If you still have the program for the newspaper problem
in the Code editor, change it so that you use <code>repeat()</code> wherever it would
shorten the code.  If you don't have it, go back to the previous lesson and redo it using
<code>repeat()</code>.</p>
