<h1>Hurdles again!</h1>
<p>Have a look at worlds <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;1</span> and
<span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;2</span>.  Ignoring the end goal for a second, a program
that Reeborg could follow to race over these hurdles would alternate between two instructions</p>
<ul><li><code>move();</code></li>
<li><code>jump_over_hurdle();</code></li></ul>
<p>with the appropriate definition for <code>jump_over_hurdle()</code>.  If you could include
a test (<code>if</code> statement) at some point to see if you have reached the goal, you could
use the above to create a new function, that we could call <code>move_and_jump_until_done()</code>
so that a program suitable for both worlds <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;1</span> and
<span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;2</span> would be:</p>
<pre class="jscode">
repeat(move_and_jump_until_done, 42);</pre>
<p>Write such a program and make sure it works.</p>
<p><b>Could this program work without changing anything for world
    <span class="world">Hurdles&nbsp;4</span>?</b></p>
