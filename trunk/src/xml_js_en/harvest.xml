<h1>Harvest time</h1>
<p>Reeborg has been gardening and it is time to harvest.  Select world
    <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;1</span>, <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;2</span> or
    <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;3</span> and have Reeborg collect all the tokens which represent
plants to harvest.</p>
<p>Notice how one can view the first worlds <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;1</span> and
<span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;3</span> as having horizontal (or vertical) rows having the same length, while
world <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;2</span> can be seen as having diagonal rows having the same length.</p>
<p>Alternatively, select world <span class="world">Harvest&nbsp;4</span> which occurred
earlier in the season.  Reeborg had been planting some carrots; some sprouted fine, others did not,
while at some location 2 or more seeds sprouted.  Reeborg must remove the excess plants and reseed
at locations where there are missing ones so that each plant site has only one plant (token).</p>
