<h1>Testing the ImprovedRobot</h1>

<p>Congratulations! You should now be able to design a new robot that is completely free of bugs.  It should be
capable of:</p>
<ul><li>seeing if there is a wall both to its left and to its right without having to do turns (that
would leave traces if performed);</li>
<li>being able to turn right directly</li>
<li>being able to turn on or off the oil leak upon creation;</li>
<li>being able to determine which direction (East, North, West or South) it is facing.</li></ul>
<p>Do so and make sure to test it thoroughly.  Then use this new robot to solve some of the
challenges, in particular the two where the robot has to get out of a maze.</p>
